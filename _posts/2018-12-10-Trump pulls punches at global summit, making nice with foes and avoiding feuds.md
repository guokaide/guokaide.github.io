[Trump pulls punches at global summit, making nice with foes and avoiding feuds ](https://reading.liulishuo.com/share/audios/NGU4MDEwMDAwMDAwMDEzYQ==?login=44086617) 



## Reading

President Donald Trump managed to spend two days in the company of world leaders he has long antagonized without any visible eruptions.

There were no feuds, or at least none publicly detected, as Air Force One took off from Buenos Aires on Saturday night. Trump signed on to a statement of principles with the other leaders at the Group of 20 summit, the kind of document he refused to endorse at a summit in Canada a few months earlier. He curtailed his ambitions by canceling his meeting with Putin, and made nice with the European leader he most regularly trashes, German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Trump's self-restraint continued as he answered a few questions from reporters. When one asked whether he had any regrets about his past criticisms of Bush and his family, Trump paused for a moment and then decided not to engage.

The G-20 is a multilateral organization, but Trump and some of his advisers are hostile to the concept of group decision-making. So Trump's assent to the joint statement of G-20 leaders reflected a compromise. The document reiterates a shared commitment to a "rules-based international order" and global trade, but includes a critique of the World Trade Organization, a body Trump rails against.

Thomas Wright, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said, "The worry was that things could unravel, so there was a retraction of ambition from the other democratic leaders. They are worried about him creating a fuss over attempts to forge cooperation, which means these summits now are just gatherings of the leaders without a real agenda. That's the function of Trump."

3、There were no feuds, or at least none **publicly detected**, as Air Force One took off from Buenos Aires on Saturday night. Trump **signed on to a statement of principles** with the other leaders at ***the Group of 20 summit***, the kind of document (***that***) he refused to endorse at a summit in Canada a few months earlier. He **curtailed** his ambitions by canceling his meeting with Putin, and made nice with the European leader he most regularly **trashes**, German **Chancellor** Angela Merkel.

截止至周六晚，当空军一号从布宜诺斯艾利斯起飞时，特朗普没有和人结仇，或者至少没有公开结仇。在 20 国集团峰会上，特朗普和其他领导人签署了一项原则声明。几个月前，特朗普还拒绝在加拿大召开的峰会上签署类似的文件。他收敛野心，取消了与普京的会面，并与他最经常抨击的欧洲领导人——德国总理安格拉·默克尔——“友好相处”了。

4、Trump's **self-restraint** continued as he answered a few questions from reporters. When one asked whether he had any regrets about his past criticisms of Bush and his family, Trump paused for a moment and then decided not to **engage**.

在答记者问时，特朗普依然是自我克制的。当记者问他是否后悔多次批评布什及其家族时，特朗普停顿了一下，然后决定不继续回答这个问题。

5、The G-20 is a **multilateral** organization, but Trump and some of his advisers are **hostile** to the concept of **group decision-making**. So Trump's **assent** to the **joint statement** of G-20 leaders reflected a compromise. The document **reiterates** a shared **commitment** to a "rules-based international order" and global trade, but includes a **critique** of the World Trade Organization, a **body** (***WTO***)Trump **rails against**. 

G20 是一个多边组织，但是特朗普和他的一些顾问反对“集体决策”这个概念。所以，特朗普对 G20 领导人共同声明的赞成反映了他的妥协。这份文件重申了对“基于规则的国际秩序”和世界贸易的共同承诺，但也包括了对世贸组织的评论 。特朗普曾攻击过这个组织。

6、Thomas Wright, a senior fellow at the **Brookings Institution**, said, "The worry was that things could **unravel**, so there was a **retraction** of ambition from the other **democratic** leaders. They are worried about him creating a **fuss** over attempts to **forge** cooperation, which means these summits now are just **gatherings** of the leaders without a real agenda. That's the function of Trump."

**布鲁金斯学会**的高级研究员托马斯·赖特说道：“大家担心峰会局面可能会崩溃，所以其他民主政体的领导人才收敛了他们的野心。他们担心他（特朗普）在各方尝试展开合作的过程中大放厥词，而这样的担心意味着这类峰会如今变成了缺乏实际议程的领导人集会。这就是特朗普的作用。”
