## Reading

More than 1,000 assorted pieces of plastic, including 115 cups, 25 bags, four bottles and two flip-flops, have been found inside a dead sperm whale in Indonesia, according to local officials.

> 印度尼西亚地方官员表示，他们在当地一头死去的抹香鲸体内发现了 1000 多块各种各样的塑料制品，其中包括 115 个塑料杯、25 个塑料袋、四个塑料瓶和两个塑料人字拖。

The whale, found washed ashoreMonday in Wakatobi National Park, was already decomposing when rescuers arrived, so investigators were unable to determine if the plastic caused its death, said Lukas Adhyakso, the conservationdirector of the World Wildlife Fund in Indonesia. The plastic weighed about 6 kilograms, or 13 pounds, he said.

> Lukas Adhyakso 是印尼世界野生动物基金会的自然保护主任。他表示，周一，该鲸鱼在瓦卡托比海上国家公园被人发现，尸体被海水冲到了岸边，在救援人员赶到之前已经开始腐烂，所以调查人员无法确定塑料是否是它的死亡原因。他说，鲸鱼体内的塑料重达 6 千克，约合 13 磅。

But images of the dead whale resonated in Indonesia, a country that has started to reckon with its outsize use of plastics. Indonesia, a nation of about 260 million people spread over thousands of islands in Southeast Asia, was the world’s second-biggest producer of plastic waste in 2015, behind only China, according to a study in the journal Science.

> 然而鲸鱼尸体的照片在印度尼西亚产生了巨大的反响。印度尼西亚已经开始意识到，过量的塑料使用是个问题。该国拥有约 2.6 亿人口，他们分布在数千个东南亚的岛屿上。根据一项发表在《科学》期刊上的研究，印度尼西亚是 2015 年世界第二大塑料废品生产国，仅次于中国。

Ingesting plastic can give whales a false sense of satiation, leading them to eat less food that provides the nutrients they need, said Nicholas Mallos, director of the Trash Free Seas program at Ocean Conservancy, an environmental nonprofit. Consumption of plastics can lead to reduced weight, energy and swimming speed, making whales more vulnerable topredators.

> Nicholas Mallos 是非盈利环境保护机构海洋保育协会的“无垃圾海洋”项目主任。他说，摄入塑料会给鲸鱼造成一种虚假的饱腹感，导致它们减少食物的摄入，而食物能为它们提供所需营养。摄取塑料会导致体重降低，能量减少，游泳速度减慢，从而使鲸鱼更容易受到掠食者的伤害。

More than 800 species of marine animals are susceptible to the estimated 8.8 million tons of plastics deposited each year in the ocean, Mallos said, and often in ways that do not lead to graphic imagery like the whale in Indonesia. Plastics can entangle and trap animals, sometimes causing them to drown, or pierce elements of their digestive systems after being swallowed.

> Mallos 补充道，每年有超过 800 种海洋动物受到大约 880 万吨被随意丢弃在海洋中的塑料影响，通常这些影响不会像印度尼西亚鲸鱼尸体的生动图像那样以如此直接的方式呈现。塑料会缠住、卡住动物，有时会导致它们被淹死。塑料被动物吞下后，也可能刺穿它们的消化器官。
